# Employee Management System

# It is a simple Employee Management System
where you can Add, Delete, Update or Search your employee's details. Since not many routes were there. Hence I have put it in controller.js with the database parameters.

To Run on your system

1. Clone the project
2. Open the cmd and cd to the cloned folder's path and run npm install.
3. type nodemon.
4. Now open your browser and type localhost:3000

And here it is

# The Dashboard with preview of all employees

# New Employee can be added by clicking the button
A modal form fades in and
![add](Emp-3.png)

# You can even search the employees with their name
Helps in case of greater number of data

# By clicking on the employee preview, You can see their full details

# You can also update the details
The form is prefilled

# You can also delete the employee from the database
